# SudokuSolver
<p>This is an ObjectOriented, <b>absolutely not optimized</b>, Sudoku solver.
It was born during a hospital stay, for fun.</p>

<p>I'm using logical methods, and for simple games that's enough.
If needed, the solver uses backtracking (brute force) to find a solution. Potentially slow</p>

<p>The game must be a txt file in a format like:</p>

n n n n n n n n n<br>
n - n n - n - n n<br>
n n - n - n - n n<br>
n n - n n n n n n<br>
n n n - n n n n n<br>
n n n n n n n n n<br>
n - - - n - - - n<br>
n n n n n n n n n<br>
n n n n n n n n n<br>
