# SudokuSolver
<p>This is an ObjectOriented, absolutely not optimized, Sudoku solver.
It's born during a hospital stay, for fun.</p>

<p>I'm using logical methods, and for simple games that's enough.
If necessary, i've used backtracking (brute force) to find a solution, so this is guaranteed to find a solution, if exists.</p>

<p>The game must be a txt file in a format like:</p>

n n n n n n n n n<br>
n - n n - n - n n<br>
n n - n - n - n n<br>
n n - n n n n n n<br>
n n n - n n n n n<br>
n n n n n n n n n<br>
n - - - n - - - n<br>
n n n n n n n n n<br>
n n n n n n n n n<br>
